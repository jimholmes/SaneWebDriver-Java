# SaneWebDriver-Java
Examples for a WebDriver workshop I give.

## Installing
This project was built using Eclipse Oxygen and Java 1.8.

Clone the project if you've experience in Git, or just download the Zip. Either way, place the project (clone or Zip) in a working directory somewhere. You can open the workspace directly from Eclipse, or import the Zip file.

### Using the Examples
The examples use a demo site I've built with a KendoUI grid. That particular project
is at https://github.com/jimholmes/Demo-Site. Grab it and host it locally if you want.

For now there's a live version hosted at http://jhdemos.azurewebsites.net/KendoGrid.html. No guarantees that site will stay live.

The examples are meant to tell a progressive story on moving to a good pattern of test writing.
